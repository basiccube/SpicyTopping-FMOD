# Pizza Tower: The Spicy Topping FMOD Studio Project

This repository contains the FMOD Studio project for Pizza Tower: The Spicy Topping. This project is used specifically only for the music right now, and itself isn't useful at all without having the mod itself, which is currently not available to the public.

This project will not work with the base game, as it is for the most part made entirely from scratch.
If you are looking for something that does work with the base game, use [Raltyro's Pizza Tower FMOD Studio Project Recreation](https://github.com/Raltyro/Pizza-Tower-fspro-Recreation).

To open this project, you'll need FMOD Studio 2.02, which you can find [here](https://fmod.com). The rest is pretty straightforward.
